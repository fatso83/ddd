DDD-3.4.1 (Serengeti)
=====================

Enhancements
------------
Font handling has been redesigned to use XFT client-side fonts.  The font 
preference menu now has a drop-down menu to select compatible fonts.

Add side-by-side view for source and data.

Add dark mode.

Line number width adapts to the size of source file.

Display of UTF-8 in source window and debugger console.

Convert ddd.1 (ddd.man) to UTF-8.

Change default editors gvim or emacs, instead of kdevelop and vi in xterm.

Remove Make and Edit buttons from Tool Bar.

Fix dialogs for register, breakpoints, displays.


Build issues
------------
Several issues which prevented building on macOS have been resolved.

DDD is now built with internal X11 default attributes, vsl definitions.
Several --enable-builtin-x options removed.  

Additional derived files are built in the build directory instead of 
the source directory.

Support parallel make (-j <n>).  

Eliminate unneeded functions and headers.

Cleanup and reorganization in multiple areas: M4 use in Makefile, GDBAgent.

Correct prereq script for Ubuntu/Debian.


Miscelaneous
------------
Obsolete files have been removed: PROBLEMS, ddd.spec, GDB manual, FONTS
