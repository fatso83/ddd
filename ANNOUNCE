**********************

What is DDD?
============

DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB 
or CUDA-GDB.  Besides common GUI front-end features such as viewing 
source texts, DDD has become famous through its interactive graphical 
data display, where data structures are displayed as graphs.

More information is available at the GNU DDD homepage at

      http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/


Who are the maintainers?
========================

Michael Eager and Stefan Eickeler took over as co-maintainers of 
DDD in August, 2021.  


What's new in DDD?
==================

DDD has been updated to build and run on the latest releases of
Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSuse.  The build process has been streamlined
and all warnings resolved.  There have been improvements in font 
handling, including removing dependance on Adobe fonts.  There 
have been a number of functional improvements.  Finally, approximately
30 bugs have been fixed.  

(For detailed information about the most recent release, please 
see the file "NEWS".  Information about past releases is in the 
file "NEWS-OLD".)


Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The ddd-3.4.0.tar.gz distribution file can be found here:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ddd/.

You can also build DDD from the project Subversion repository.  
Information about viewing or downloading these sources can be
found here: https://savannah.gnu.org/svn/?group=ddd

The releases can be found under 'branches' while the current (and
possibly unstable) sources are found under 'trunk'.  The current 
ddd-3.4) release is svn.savannah.gnu.org/ddd/branch/DDD_3_4_0..

For a list of prequisites and instruction for building DDD, see 
the INSTALL file.

Known and unknown problems
==========================

DDD is based on X Window System (also called X or X11) and the 
Motif Toolkit.  Both have a decades-long history.  X is being 
replaced on several Linux distributions by Wayland, with improvements 
in speed and security.  The XWayland server supports X clients on 
systems running Wayland.  DDD has not been tested using XWayland.

DDD uses server-side fonts while most modern applications use client
side client-side fonts.  If you wish to change fonts, please read 
the FONTS file.

This release of DDD has not been built or tested on MacOS or z/OS.
Testers are welcomed and invited to submit bug reports.

The previous release, ddd-3.3.12 (released in 2009), supported a 
variety of Unix or Linux hosts distributions which are no longer 
available.  It also supported a variety of debug engines such as
DBX, PYDB, BASHDB, and PERLDB.  While the code to support building
on these hosts or using these debuggers has been retained in the 
current version of DDD, there has been no testing of either.
Support for obsolete hosts or debuggers may be removed in the future.

DDD depends on recognizing the prompt used by GDB to tell when 
GDB has completed printing and is ready for input.  Changing the 
GDB prompt, for example, in a .gdbinit file, will result in DDD
being unable to communicate with GDB.
