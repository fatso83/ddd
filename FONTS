DDD and Fonts
=============

DDD uses the X font system.  This system was originally developed to 
support the use of bitmapped fonts on CRT displays.  It has been extended 
and modified several times since it's introduction with X11R1 in 1987.  
In addition to bitmapped fonts, the X font system supports OpenType, 
TrueType, PCF, and Adobe Type 1 PostScript scalable fonts.[1]  Font 
support in X is provided in two ways:  server-side or client-side. 
Essentially, this is whether font rendering is provided by an X server 
for all clients, or whether the font rendering is done by each individual 
GUI client.  

DDD uses server-side fonts.  Server-side fonts have long been deprecated;
most modern applications use client-side fonts.  Server-side fonts can be 
listed using the 'xlsfonts' utility.  Client-side fonts are listed using 
the 'fc-list' utility.  DDD uses the 'xfontsel' utility (or its underlying 
library) to select the fonts it uses.  

Server-side fonts use the X Logical Font Description (XLFD) font naming 
standard.  A font name is made up of various characteristics, separated
by dashes:
 -foundry-family-weight-slant-width-style-pixels-points-hDPI-vDPI-spacing-avgwidth-charset

For example:
  -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1
is name of the Courier (family) font supplied by Adobe (foundry).  It is the 
bold, roman (as opposed to italic or oblique) version of the normal (that is 
not expanded or condensed) font set.  Each character is 10 pixels wide, 10 
points (100/10) wide, designed to be rendered at 75dpi (both horizontally 
and vertically).  It is a monospaced font (rather than proportional) where 
the average character is 6 (60/10) pixels wide.  The font encoding is ISO-8859-1 
(8-bit, single byte, Western Europe aka ISO Latin 1).  

In many cases, asterisks can be used as wildcards.  Instead of the font name
listed above, you can specify:
  *courier-bold-*r*100*
Or you can omit some characteristics if the other characteristics uniquely
identify the font:
  -*-courier-bold-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Additionally, there are a number of aliases for fonts.  The most common is
  fixed:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1

Choice of fonts
===============

With version ddd-3.4, the default fonts used by DDD are Liberation Fonts, 
which are designed to be compatible with Times New Roman, Arial, and 
Courier New.  They are licensed under the SIL Open Font License[2].
DDD uses both normal and bold font styles as well as monospaced (fixed) and
proportional spaced fonts.  

You may select a different font by going to Edit>Preferences>Fonts and
either entering in the XLFD font name, abbreviation, or alias, or by selecting
the font using the Browse button which will invoke the 'xfontsel' font selection
tool.  DDD only supports ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) font encoding.

Font Errors
===========

When DDD cannot find a font, it will issue warnings like the following:
   Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-liberation sans-medium-r-normal--0-120-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1" to type FontStruct
   Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-liberation sans-medium-r-normal--0-100-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1" to type FontStruct

This indicates that the specified font cannot be found on the X server.
DDD will use a fallback font for the missing font, such as 'fixed'.

You can verify whether a font has been installed on the server by running
the X utility program 'xfontsel'.  Click on 'fmly' and see if the desired
font family ('liberation' in the above warning messages) is listed.

Installing fonts
================

On some Linux distributions, when a font is installed using the distro's 
package manager, it is only installed as a client-side font.  DDD will not
be able to find the font.  There are two ways to remedy this, the first is
system-wide (needing root privileges) and the second for local user-specific fonts.
Liberation Fonts are used in this example; if you use a different font replace
the name as required. (Different Linux distributions install fonts in different
locations or in multiple locations.  The paths used in this example are for 
Ubuntu and may need to be modified for your distribution.)

For system fonts:
  1.  Install Liberation fonts
    $ sudo apt-get install fonts-liberation
  2.  Create font management files
    $ sudo cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation
    $ sudo mkfontscale
    $ sudo mkfontdir
  3.  Update FontPath
    $ sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-fontpath.conf
    Section "Files"
        FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation"
    EndSection
  4.  Reboot
  5.  Check fonts:
     $ xset -q | tail
    ...
    Font Path
    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation,/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,built-ins
    ...
    $ xfontsel
    Under fmly, look for liberation-mono, liberation-sans, etc.

For local fonts:
  1.  Make local font directory
    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
  2.  Download Liberation fonts
    $ cd ~/.local/share/fonts
    $ wget https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts/files/7261482/liberation-fonts-ttf-2.1.5.tar.gz
    (Latest fonts at https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts/releases)
    $ tar xfvz liberation-fonts-ttf-2.1.5.tar.gz
    $ mkfontscale
    $ mkfontdir
  3.  Update bash startup script
    $ F=`pwd`
    $ echo "xset +fp $F" >> ~/.bashrc
  4.  Source bash starup script
    $ . ~/.bashrc
  5.  Check fonts:
     $ xset -q | tail
    ...
    Font Path
    /home/<userid>/.local/share/fonts,/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,built-ins
    ...
    $ xfontsel
    Under fmly, look for liberation-mono, liberation-sans, etc.


Using X2Go server
=================

X2Go[3] is a remote desktop application, similar VNC[4] or RDP[5], based
on the NX (NoMachine) libraries[6].  The font path is hard-coded in the
libraries and updates to the FontPath as described above does not work.
The font path when using X2Go is "/usr/share/nx/fonts/misc" which is a 
link to "/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc".  

The workaround to using Liberation (or other) fonts on X2Go is to copy them 
to "/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc" and create fonts.dir and fonts.scale.  The 
following example uses paths from a Fedora distribution.

  $ cd /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc
  $ sudo cp /usr/share/fonts/liberation-mono/*.ttf .
  $ sudo cp /usr/share/fonts/liberation-sans/*.ttf .
  $ sudo cp /usr/share/fonts/liberation-serif/*.ttf .
  $ sudo mkfontdir
  $ sudo mkfontscale

Reboot your system, reconnect with X2Go, and check using xfontsel as 
described above.
